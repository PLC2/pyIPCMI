# Contributing to pyIPCMI

Currently, we have no contribution rules, so feel free to submit pull requests (PRs).


### Contributor License Agreement

We require all contributers to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you don't know
what for a CLA is needed and how it prevents legal issues on both sides, read [this short
blog](https://www.clahub.com/pages/why_cla) post.

So to get started, [sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLAHub].
